    "For this project, I have chosen the `character_descriptions.csv` dataset, which contains detailed descriptions of fictional characters from theater, television, and film. This dataset is appropriate because it provides rich, structured information about a diverse set of characters, including their personalities, backgrounds, and relationships. By customizing the chatbot with this data, we can create a conversational agent that can answer questions about these characters, simulate their personalities, or help users explore stories and settings in a more interactive way. This customization is particularly useful for applications in creative writing, education, or entertainment, where users may want to interact with or learn about fictional characters in depth."
